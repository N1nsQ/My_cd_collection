# My CD collection - Creating a database from scratch
<img src="https://github.com/nina20126/My_cd_collection/assets/77397102/590e88b6-6a3a-4006-ab22-7a18f0cb3a7a" alt="picture of my personal cd collection" width="450"><br />

With this project I learned a lot about database desing, relationships between tables and SQL commands. I created a local server with MySQL Workbench where the database is located. This database and all its information are based on my personal collection of cd's.
  
In this repository I am storing the information of how the database is created, what kind of tables it has and some example queries with their results. I am also planning to develop this project further and create a website where user can browse the collection and add more data. More about this later.

### What did I learn? 
* database design
* relationships between tables
* junction tables
* database normalization
* SQL queries
* MySQL, MySQL Workbench

### Tools used in this project
[MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/)  
[Quick Database Diagrams]()  
[Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/)  


### How to improve the database in future
* add record studio information for all albums
* Current band members and past band members listed
* is band still active
* add album cover image
* add album type: is it studio record, live record, single, collection album etc
* country where the band is from

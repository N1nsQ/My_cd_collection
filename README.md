With this project I learned a lot about database desing, relationships between tables and SQL commands. I created a local server with MySQL Workbench where the database is located. This database and all its information are based on my personal collection of cd's.
  
In this repository I am storing the information of how the database is created, what kind of tables it has and some example queries with their results. I am also planning to develop this project further and create a website where user can browse the collection and add more data. More about this later.

### What did I learn? 
* database design
* relationships between tables
* junction tables
* database normalization
* SQL queries
* MySQL, MySQL Workbench

### Tools used in this project
